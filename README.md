### `NodeJS + ReactJS`

`main idea: `

I tried to build a website for myself. It includes categories and articles.
Each article has HTML file and name. Besides, site has an auth for admins to manage itself.
Also, I add some privacy: each Readme provides more information
about it.

`to start: `

1. configure docker and kubernetes
2. start frontend app 
3. start backend app

ðŸ”¥ `also check `

Readme.md (backend && frontend)
